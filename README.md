# Prallel-Algorithm-for-Longest-Common-Subsequence
The LCS problem deals with comparing two sequences and finding the maximum length subsequence which is common to the two given sequences.
The LCS algorithm is widely used in many areas, which includes the field of gene engineering to compare DNA of patients with that of healthy ones.
For solving the LCS problem, we resort to dynamic programming approach. Due to the growth of database sizes of biological sequences, parallel algorithms are the best solution to solve these large size problems.

Goals:
1. Implementing sequential and parallel dynamic programming algorithms for Longest common subsequence problem using optimum number of processors.
2. Comparing parallel algorithm with sequential algorithm.
3. Analysing Time complexity, Speed up, Work and
Cost efficiency of the parallel algorithm.
